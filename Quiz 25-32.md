Consider a 4-bit SAR converter with Vref+ = 2V  (Vref- = 0) similar to what is shown in the below figure.
![[SAR-1.jpg]]
If Vin, the input voltage, is 1.6 V, compute the values of the analog guess, VDAC for the 4 passes of the conversion, and provide the digital output by completing the following table. There is one row for each round of SAR, which is given in the first column. You need to enter the VDAC in the second column. You have to enter the index of the bit that is being calculated (resolved in this round) in the third column. This is going to be 0 for LSB and 3 for MSB and something in between for the other two bits. Finally, the last column is for the value of the resolved bit. So, if you decide the bit is 1, you put 1 for that column and 0, otherwise.
